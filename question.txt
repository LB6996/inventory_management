Write down the answers to the following questions in your notebook (rewatch the video if you need to.)

Who initiates an HTTP request?
the user

How does the server match the correct view function to the HTTP request?
uwww.example.come/contact in URL will look for /contact route in server.py, if available, routes to 
provided html page.

Where does a form submit data to?
When a user submits a form, the data goes to /store_form, upon succesful registration, 
data will be registered into the database accordingly.

What happens when we return a redirect?
it goes from /store_form to /store, and a new GET request is issued to 
the server to render the /store's information. Typically used to redirect
user to where they had left off.

What happens when we return a render?
it renders the /store's information, but can also do much complicated task 
along with it. Typically used to take user to further process after certain task.

Why do we redirect rather than render when we successfully save?
In this case, we can actually used both? just need to remove 'name=request...' the render_template.
